# Answer Key for the MS JS Pre-Assessment

## Accessing the Answer Key
The answer key is contained in 'answers.js,' which is in the root directory of this repo.

## Placement Guide
Use the placement guide as follows: If a student answers all questions through question-XX correctly, find the row of the guide containing question-XX. The second column of this row dictates which curriculum week/lesson the student should start with.

| Question Answered Correctly | Starting Week/Lesson |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| question-01 |   Week 01   |
| question-02 |   Week 02   |
| question-03 |   Week 02   |
| question-04 |   Week 03   |
| question-05 |   Week 04   |
| question-06 |   Week 04   |
| question-07 |   Week 05   |
| question-08 |   Week 06   |
| question-09 |   Week 07   |
| question-10 |   Week 09   |
| question-11 |   Week 10   |
| question-12 |   Week 11   |

If a student answers all 12 questions correctly, please contact the Director of STEM Programming or the Chief Academic Officer. The student should still complete Weeks 11 and 12 of the curriculum, but an alternate plan will need to be created for them, and the adminstrators above will help with that.
